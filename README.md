### 1. INITIAL DESIGN

- I am a big fan of professional wrestling. Whether it maybe WWE, AEW ( as well as defunct companies like WCW). I knew, I wanted to a project wrestling elated, and I decided My first project will be a wrestling themed bar in the heart of London.



#### The Main features would include

-Background Pictures - wrestling related
-Navigation Menu
-Quick information the user needs ( About, Menu and Openings)



### 2. FINAL DESIGN

WIREFRAMES

### 3.USER EXPERIENCE

## Aims

- The site needs to be easy to use
- Moving the mouse around the site needs to be simple
- The site needs to provide the information needs when visiting the website ( About, Menu and contact details)
- Images that show what the bar looks like inside and the layout 

## First Time Visitors

- The browser must find the website easy to use
- I want the browser to understand what the place is about/what we offer

  

## Design

  ## COLOR SCHEME

  The Colours I used were black and Burlywood - I used burleywood, because with black in the background the information really stands out, and catches the viewer at first glance.

 

## FEATURES
I have used the following features in this project

## HOVER

Tells the user the location of the mouse whilst navigating the menu.
Helps the user not lose their place.
