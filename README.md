### 3.USER EXPERIENCE
### Aims
- The site needs to be easy to use
- Moving the mouse around the site needs to be simple
- The site needs to provide the information needs when visiting the website ( About, Menu and contact details)
- Images that show what the bar looks like inside and the layout 
### First Time Visitors
- The browser must find the website easy to use
- I want the browser to understand what the place is about/what we offer
### Design
### COLOR SCHEME
The Colours I used were black and Burlywood - I used burlywood, because with black in the background the information really stands out, and catches the viewer at first glance.
