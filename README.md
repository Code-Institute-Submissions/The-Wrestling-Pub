### 1. INITIAL DESIGN
I am a big fan of professional wrestling. Whether it maybe WWE, AEW ( as well as defunct companies like WCW). I knew, I wanted to a project wrestling elated, and I decided My first project will be a wrestling themed bar in the heart of London.

*** The Main Features would include***

1. Background Pictures which are wrestling related
2. Navigation Menu
3. Quick information the user needs ( About, Menu and Openings)

### 2. FINAL DESIGN

### 3.USER EXPERIENCE

### Aims
- The site needs to be easy to use
- Moving the mouse around the site needs to be simple
- The site needs to provide the information needs when visiting the website ( About, Menu and contact details)
- Images that show what the bar looks like inside and the layout 

### First Time Visitors
- The browser must find the website easy to use
- I want the browser to understand what the place is about/what we offer 

### Design

### COLOR SCHEME
The Colours I used were black and Burlywood - I used burlywood, because with black in the background the information really stands out, and catches the viewer at first glance.
